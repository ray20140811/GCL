A facility for completion and on line help in emacs, for common lisp
documentation is provided.
To use this facility you must have gnu emacs, and you must copy the
lsp/*.el files into the emacs/lisp directory.

cp lsp/*.el /usr/local/src/emacs/lisp
(or onto a path in the emacs load-path)

You must also
make -f Smakefile doc

Also install print_doc onto your search path
mv xbin/print_doc /usr/local/bin

Load library find-doc
Now the keystroke
C-h d
will then obtain documentation on any common lisp symbol, in the other
window, just as emacs does.

To build documentation on a collection of lisp files:

xbin/edoc *.lisp
